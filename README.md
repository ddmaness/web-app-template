# Web App Template

## Description

A starter template for my web app projects.

## How to Run

Clone or download this repository and run npm install in the root project directory. After all dependencies are downloaded run gulp to start the development server and enable automatic reloading on changes to Sass, JS, or html files. gulp dist will optimize the images, and JS files for production and copy these optimized files to the production dist directory.
